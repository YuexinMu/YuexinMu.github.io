Welcome to my academic homepage ðŸ‘‹  

I am currently a Master's student at **Chongqing University**, advised by **Prof. Duo Liu** and **Prof. Ao Ren**. My research focuses on **LiDAR-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)** and **decentralized/distributed robotic systems**. Specifically, I am interested in **LiDAR-IMU state estimation**, **distributed optimization for multi-robot systems**, and **efficient point cloud data structures**, aiming to achieve high **accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance** in complex environments.  

My recent research projects include:  
- **AccFast-LIO**: A LiDAR-inertial odometry system that introduces a dynamic pose chain and loop sparsification to combine the efficiency of filtering with the accuracy of optimization.  
- **D2SLAM**: A decentralized SLAM system featuring asynchronous distributed pose graph optimization and visual-inertial state estimation, designed for multi-UAV swarms.  
- **LIO-HKDT**: A LiDAR-inertial odometry framework with a novel **Hash KDTree** data structure for fast point cloud insertion and KNN search in a sliding-window map.  
- **PathFollowLocalPlanner (ROS)**: A path-following local planner with state machine control, preview point calculation, dynamic parameter tuning, and visualization support.  

In addition to research, I have also been actively involved in academic and cultural events at Chongqing University, including organizing the **Chinese Language Day Celebration** and assisting with the **School of Foreign Languages commencement ceremony and admissions outreach**.  

This website is built with the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and showcases my **publications, projects, teaching, and academic activities**.
